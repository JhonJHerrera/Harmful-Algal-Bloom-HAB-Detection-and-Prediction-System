# Harmful-Algal-Bloom-HAB-Detection-and-Prediction-System-
This project aims to develop an advanced early warning system for Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs) in the San Jos√© Lagoon, San Juan, Puerto Rico. The lagoon frequently experiences toxic cyanobacterial blooms, which deplete oxygen levels, harm aquatic life, and negatively impact local recreation and the economy.
