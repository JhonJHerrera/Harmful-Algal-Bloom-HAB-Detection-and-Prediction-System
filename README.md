# Harmful-Algal-Bloom-HAB-Detection-and-Prediction-System-
This project aims to develop an advanced early warning system for Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs) in the San José Lagoon, San Juan, Puerto Rico. The lagoon frequently experiences toxic cyanobacterial blooms, which deplete oxygen levels, harm aquatic life, and negatively impact local recreation and the economy.

Using satellite imagery, geospatial data analysis, and predictive modeling, this system seeks to provide timely alerts to mitigate the effects of HABs. While focused on the San José Lagoon, the methodology could serve as a model for addressing similar environmental challenges in other regions.
